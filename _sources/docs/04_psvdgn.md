# Evaluating Passive HVAC Design Strategies
Architects have major control over the programming, building form and building envelope of a project which have significant influence on HVAC system performance. With minimal reliance on mechanical systems, passive HVAC strategies consciously design these architectural components to reduce the thermal loads of active HVAC systems, and thus reduce HVAC energy consumption. In this workshop, I will introduce the 3D sunpath tool by Dr Andrew Marsh to support the design of windows and shading, and use OpenStudio Application to evaluate the performance of the strategy.
